## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS preprocessor
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I mainly learned how SCSS behaves in relation to CSS and how it can be useful. For example, we can nest tags within tags with more readability than CSS, as in the section below:

```scss
.attribution {
    font-size: .7em;
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 5%;

    a {
        color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%);
    }

    @include mixins.tablet {
        font-size: .9em;
    }

    @include mixins.large-tablet {
        font-size: 1em;
    }
}
```

We can also create mixins and variables, which makes coding faster and more organized. In addition, I was able to learn more basic and useful JavaScript properties and to work better using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

### Continued development

For future projects, I intend to work and improve my skills and competencies in:

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- SCSS
  
I also plan to start studying some JavaScript frameworks like React, in addition to starting with the basics of databases and backend with the Python framework Django.

### Useful resources

- [Link to video](https://youtu.be/ZyFDF_2r-Dk?si=RV0CWXZLlfjy1J3A) - This video helped me build the ‘switch’ button present on the site, the creator explains in a direct and clear way. Watching the video makes it easy to make adaptations to the tool so that it fits your site.
- Copilot (AI of the EDGE browser) - is a powerful tool that has helped me correct errors and also giving ideas for problem solving. It is important to note that we should not copy codes generated by AI, but rather learn from them various ways of how to solve a problem and adapt it to our own way of coding.
